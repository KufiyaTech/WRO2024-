## Project Overview
This project is developed for the WRO Future Engineers 2024 competition and focuses on designing and programming an autonomous robotic car. The car is capable of navigating a white map marked with distinct blue and orange lines, utilizing a combination of advanced sensors such as the TCS3200 for color detection and an IMU for precise turning. The primary goal is to optimize the car's performance during the competition, specifically excelling in the obstacle challenge and open challenge rounds.

The competition requires a sophisticated approach to both hardware and software. Weâ€™ve integrated robust algorithms that allow the car to autonomously make decisions based on real-time data from its sensors. This not only showcases the car's ability to navigate and avoid obstacles but also emphasizes its capacity to follow designated paths with high accuracy. The project encompasses several engineering disciplines, including electronics, mechanics, and software development, making it a comprehensive example of modern engineering applied to robotics.


### 1.1 Competition Context

The WRO Future Engineers 2024 competition challenges teams to design and develop autonomous vehicles capable of navigating a predefined course while executing specific tasks. This competition is structured across multiple rounds, including a practice round, two qualification rounds, and a final round, each progressively testing the vehicle's capabilities.

Participants must engineer their vehicles to handle complex challenges such as lane following, obstacle detection, and precise turning. The competition track is designed with a variety of elements, including straight paths, curves, and intersections, which the vehicle must navigate autonomously without human intervention. 

Scoring is based on the vehicle's ability to complete the course with accuracy and efficiency, with additional points awarded for successful task execution and speed.

For detailed competition rules, please refer to the official WRO Future Engineers 2024 guidelines: [WRO Future Engineers 2024 Rules](https://wro-association.org/wp-content/uploads/WRO-2024-Future-Engineers-Self-Driving-Cars-General-Rules.pdf)

### How Does Our Robot Think

To ensure our vehicle can successfully complete the tasks required in both rounds of the competition, we have utilized a variety of sensors, each with a specific function, as detailed in the Power and Sense Management section of this README.

Our robot is powered by an Arduino Mega microcontroller and programmed in C++. The core logic of the vehicle relies on a PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller to navigate within the designated safe zone. The vehicle is equipped with three ultrasonic sensors and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor, which together manage the steering system effectively.

Additionally, a front-facing ultrasonic sensor is employed to detect U-turns. This combination of sensors and control algorithms forms the backbone of our robot's decision-making process, allowing it to navigate the course autonomously and efficiently.
